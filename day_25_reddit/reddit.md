# Newsletter Title: Revolutions in OpenAI & AI Augmented Chatbots!

### **WHAT THE HELL ? Claud 3 Opus is a straight revolution.**
So, I threw a wild challenge at Claud 3 Opus AI, kinda just to see how it goes, you know? Told it to make up a Pomodoro Timer app from scratch. And the result was INCREDIBLE...

Here's a breakdown of what it got:

* **The UI?** Got everything: the timer, buttons to control it, settings to tweak your Pomodoro lengths, a neat section explaining the Pomodoro Technique, and even a task list.
* **Timer logic**: Starts, pauses, resets, and switches between sessions.
* **Customize it your way**: More chill breaks? Just hit up the settings. 
* **Style**: Got some cool pulsating effects and it's responsive too, so it looks awesome no matter where you're checking it from.
* **No edits, all AI**: Yep, this was all Claud 3's magic. Dropped over 300 lines of super coherent code just like that.

Guys, I'm legit amazed here. Watching AI pull this off with zero help from me is just... wow. Had to share with y'all 'cause it's too cool not to. What do you guys think? Ever seen AI pull off something this cool?

### **Difference between these two chat bots**
Hi all - this is a bit embarassing, but I cannot for the life of me tell the difference with what is going on here and cannot find the answer through google, reddit, or even asking the chatbot itself.

I have a subscription with this chatbot app: https://chat.chatbotapp.ai/?model=gpt-3.5

Now the embarassing part:  I thought I had a subscription with OpenAI and was frustrated when my subscription did not carry over devices, apps, etc.  I am now realizing that my subscription must be with a different company/service provider.

What I don't understand is who I have a subscription with and how it is working.  My previous understanding was that companies owned LLMs, Google owning Bard/Gemini, OpenAI/Microsoft owned ChatGPT, etc.  Whatever I am subscribed to has a basic chat function, but after upgrading it also purportedly gives me the option to use GPT-4, Gemini, and Google PaLM 2.  Adding to the confusion is that the logo of the company is very similar to the one used by OpenAI's GPT.

What do I have a subscription with?  Did I get swindled? If not, a colleague sent me a custom GPT-4 model that I would like to use, but it says I need to upgrade (this one is definitely on OpenAI).  If the service I am using is actually legitimate and offers some conglomeration of services, why can't I use an OpenAI service on it that requires GPT 4?

Any help is greatly appreciated!
